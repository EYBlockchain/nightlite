# Nightlite

This library strips down the main Nightfall repository to the minimum needed to run the Nightfall
protocol on other applications.

## Installation and Configuration

To install nightlite, run `npm install --save nightlite`

These instructions assume that you're running your application on a Dockerized Linux container. The
reason for this is because Zokrates is required to run on Linux. Nightlite can presumably be run
natively on Linux, but this guide will not provide support or instruction for that.

In your Dockerfile that will be running `nightlite`, you will need to perform a multi-stage build.
Import the official ZoKrates image like so:

```Dockerfile
# Pull in a Zokrates container so that we can pull its contents into the below container.
FROM zokrates/zokrates:0.5.1 as builder
```

And then, (assuming this is your final Docker container), copy the necessary Zokrates files into
your container:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:11.15 WORKDIR /app

# Copy over Zokrates files into this container
COPY --from=builder /home/zokrates/zokrates /app/zokrates
COPY --from=builder /home/zokrates/.zokrates\* /app/stdlib
```

`Nightlite` defaults logging levels to `info`, but if you want more detailed console logs, you can
set the logging level to `verbose`, or for even more detail, `debug` by calling
`logger.setLogLevel('verbose')`

Finally, on startup, your application should run `nightfall.setProvider(<ProviderURL>)`. This will
set the provider that all Nightfall smart contract calls will use.

## Trusted Setup

The `setup/gm17` directory contains the .code files that you need in order to run the Nightfall
functions.

TEMP: Copy these files (e.g., `ft-burn.code`) over to your project. In a future update,

These .code files need to have the `generateZokratesFiles()` function run on them. This will
generate the files you need for the rest of the Nightfall protocol to work. See the specific
documentation in `setup/generateZokratesFiles()` for usage instructions.

The Trusted Setup step will take approximately one hour. The Trusted Setup step will need to be
re-run for a given .code file whenever it is changed.

## Deploy Necessary Contracts

The following contracts are necessary for Nightfall:

- Verifier_Registry
- BN256G2
- GM17_v0
- FToken
- FTokenShield
- NFTokenMetadata
- NFTokenShield

The deployment currently occurs in `zkp/migrations/2_Shield_migration.js`. We may move away from
truffle deployments and use web3 or another similar library in the future.

FToken and NFTokenMetadata are placeholder ERC721/ERC20 contracts. In order to replace them, you
need to swap the FToken/NFTokenMetadata contracts in this migration script.

## Deploy VKs to Registry

The VKs that we generated earlier in the `Trusted Setup` step need to be deployed to the Registry.
The function `loadVk()` loads the `vk.json` files we made in the Trusted Setup stage to the
VerifierRegistry contract, and then returns vkIds.

VkIds are links to the verification keys that live on the VerifierRegistry. By using VKIds instead
of the full VKs, its more gas efficient.

`loadVk()` must be called on each `vk.json`, and the resulting vkIds must be saved. Those VKs must
then be uploaded to the FTokenShield and NFTokenShield contracts via their `setVKIds()` functions.

A sample implementation can be found in Nightfall's `zkp/src/vk-controller.js`, in the function
`initializeVks()`.

## Run Nightfall Functions

There are currently six Nightfall functions, `Mint`, `Transfer`, and `Burn` for both ERC20 and
ERC721 contracts. After the above steps are completed, you can call those functions as many times as
you'd like. The above steps do not need to be repeated (assuming your environment is now setup).

Note that there are certain things that need to be stored while running these functions.

When a commitment is generated (whether its through minting a commitment, or `ft-transfer`'s
"change" mechanic), it has a `salt`, a `commitment`, and a `commitmentIndex`. All of these things
are required for later function calls. Refer to the documentation on each individual function for
more information.

## To Do

### Passing Providers

Currently, most functions that interact with smart contracts just "know" what the proper provider
is, but this isn't good. We need to figure out how to get these functions their providers.

Here are some possibilities:

1. **Pass the provider to each function**: The most straightforward, but also a lot of clutter
2. Set a "provider" singleton: Requires some additional setup from the user (probably just calling
   `setProvider()` on startup).
